                Find light in the beautiful sea, 
                <br>I choose to be happy
                <br>You and I, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky
                <br>You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
                <br>When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky<br/>
                <br>I knew that we'd become one right away
                <br>Oh, right away
                <br>At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
                <br>I saw the life inside your eyes<br/>
                <br>So shine bright, tonight, you and I
                <br>We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
                <br>Eye to eye, so alive
                <br>We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
            </a>
